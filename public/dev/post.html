			Being a developer involves harmoniously combining various factors and technologies on a day-to-day basis in order to get work done. In this article I share 5 tips on how you can boost your workflow productivity

	<h3 class="heading-3">
		What is Productivity?
	</h3>

	<p>
		Productivity is the efficiency of production of goods or services expressed by some measure. Measurements of productivity are often expressed as a ratio of an aggregate output to a single input or an aggregate input used in a production process.
	</p>

	<h3 class="heading-3">
		1. Regular Communication
	</h3>

	</p>

	<p>
		As a developer, I know that we prefer the company of computers rather than people (at least that's the case for me). In the past, Whenever I'm working on a project, I usually secluded myself up until the project I was working on was production-ready (or until I got to the testing phase). This wasn't a good habit and as you can imagine, I got several complaints on the issue from my clients.
	</p>

	<p>
		Good communication is as essential skill to possess as a developer and you should definitely work towards regular communication with your clients and those around you. 
	</p>


	<h3 class="heading-3">
		2. Automate Repetitive Tasks
	</h3>

			If you perform an operation more than 3 times, that's probably a good sign that you need to automate it.

	<p>
		Task automation is one of the perks of being a programmer. That abilitty ability to write a script that will automate a task for you is really a life hack.
	</p>

	<p>
		Whenever you're performing an operation which you normally do on a regular basis, it really helps to take sometime out of your day to write a script that can enable you complete that task much easier.
	</p>

	<p>
		My personal favourite kind of scripts are project scaffolding scripts that can give you a starting template on a project based on particular tech stack. You could also check open source repos on <a href="https://github.com/topics/task-automation" target="_blank" class="hyperlink" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> for scripts that already automate the task you're working on.
	</p>

		3. Take Regular Breaks
	</h3>

			Productivity per hour decline sharply when a person works more than 50 hours a week.

	</div>

	<p>
		As humans, we are designed to operate in blocks of time. Ideally, we are supposed to work and take regular breaks in-between. But what do we see today? In recent times, I see more people pushing forward endlessly without taking breaks.
	</p>

	<p>
		To be honest, I used to be guilty of this in the past and I probably am still guilty about this up till this day. In the past I used to work endlessly without taking breaks and I often got frustrated when I ran into bugs I couldn't solve.
	</p>

	<p>
		I switched my workflow to a dynamic pattern which works for me:
	</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Work until you get tired or start to plateau <i class="fa-regular fa-face-exhaling"></i>.
			</li>
			<li>
				When you do get tired or plateau, take a break and completely detach from work <i class="fa-solid fa-couch"></i>.
			</li>
			<li>
				In the meantime, you will subconsciously be working on the problem without knowing it <i class="fa-regular fa-face-thinking"></i>.
			</li>
			<li>
				After taking a break, get your hands dirty with the project once more <i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile"></i>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Still can't solve the issue? Google it <i class="fa-regular fa-face-grin-wink"></i>!
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h3 class="heading-3">
		4. Use Hot Reload
	</h3>

	<p class="cover">

	</p>

	<p>
		If you're working on a web app or even a mobile app I believe it would really boost your productivity if you made use of a hot reloading manager in your development workflow. In recent times, most (if not all) mainstream javaScript frontend frameworks come with a hot reloading manager in-built.
	</p>

	<p>
		Basically, a hot reloading manager, loads code changes into your dev environment. When working on web apps or sites, a hot reload manager syncs the changes you make in your codebase with your browser. 
	</p>

	<p>
		<ul class="ml-7">
			<li class="list-disc">
				<a href="https://pypi.org/project/kaki/" target="_blank" class="hyperlink" rel="noopener noreferrer">
					Kaki (Kivy)
				</a>
			</li>
			<li class="list-disc">
				<a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="_blank" class="hyperlink" rel="noopener noreferrer">
					Vite (Web apps)
				</a>
			</li>
			<li class="list-disc">
				<a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank" class="hyperlink" rel="noopener noreferrer">
					Webpack (Web apps)
				</a>
			</li>
			<li class="list-disc">

				</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

		5. Reinforce Good Habits
	</h3>

	<p class="cover">

	</p>

	<p>
		Good habits are especially important for developers to maintain. If you want to increase your productive as a developer you should reinforce good habits as well as adopt them from other successful people in the field. Some of the good habits I consider are:
	</p>

	<p>
		<ul class="ml-7">
			<li class="list-disc">Writing down your plans before actually getting on a computer</li>
			<li class="list-disc">Always commenting your code</li>
			<li class="list-disc">Writing good git commit messages</li>
			<li class="list-disc">Solving problems on your own then googling a solution</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		I belive that these habits listed above are wonderful when they become ingrained in a developer 
	</p>

	<h3 class="heading-3">
		Conclusion
	</h3>

	<p>
		These tips I put up are my personal opinion of how to maximize productivity your as a developer. These tips have helped my in my endeavors as a developer and I hope they'll be of benefit to you as well.
